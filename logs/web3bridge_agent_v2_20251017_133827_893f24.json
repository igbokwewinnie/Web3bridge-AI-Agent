Used to interact with other contracts.\n- **Abstract Contract**: A contract that cannot be deployed on its own and may contain unimplemented (abstract) functions, meant to be inherited by other contracts.\n\n## Error Handling\nSolidity provides mechanisms to handle errors and ensure contract reliability:\n\n- **Assert**: Used for internal error checking (e.g., invariants). If an `assert` condition fails, the transaction reverts, and all gas is consumed.\n- **Require**: Used to validate conditions (e.g., user inputs). If a `require` condition fails, the transaction reverts, but unused gas is refunded.\n- **Revert**: Explicitly triggers a transaction rollback with a custom error message, similar to `require`.\n\n## Function Modifiers\n- **Modifiers**: Reusable code snippets that can be applied to functions to enforce conditions or add behavior (e.g., restricting access with `onlyOwner`).",

To optimize:\n\n- Minimize public variables to reduce getter function overhead.\n- Check `Storage.sol` for complex logic in public functions, which may increase gas costs.\n- Ensure `foundry.toml` or `hardhat.config.js` sets `maxPriorityFeePerGas` to at least `2000000000` (2 gwei) to meet CoreDAO\u2019s requirements.\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Review Storage.sol:** Share your contract to verify visibility specifiers and optimize gas usage.\n2. **Confirm Chain ID:** Clarify if chain ID 1114 was a typo for 1115 (Core Testnet).\n3. **Retry Deployment:** Use the updated `foundry.toml` or Hardhat config from prior responses.\n4. **Questions:** Need help applying visibility to a specific contract or resolving the deployment error?  \n   Provide `Storage.sol` or any specific questions, and I\u2019ll tailor further guidance!\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need this in a different format or want a shorter summary!",

Principle of Least Privilege\n- Use the most restrictive visibility that satisfies your requirements\n- Start with `private` and escalate only when necessary\n\n### 2. Function Design\n- Use `external` for functions that only receive external calls\n- Use `public` for functions that need both internal and external access\n- Use `internal` for reusable utility functions\n- Use `private` for sensitive operations\n\n### 3. Variable Design\n- Use `private` for sensitive state variables\n- Use `internal` for variables shared with derived contracts\n- Use `public` for variables that need automatic getters\n\n### 4. Security Considerations\n```solidity\ncontract SecureContract {\n    // Private variables for sensitive data\n    uint256 private secretKey;\n    address private owner;\n    \n    // Internal for inheritance\n    uint256 internal lastUpdate;\n    \n    // Public for transparency\n    uint256 public totalSupply;\n    \n    // External for gas efficiency\n    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external {\n        // Implementation\n    }\n    \n    // Private for sensitive operations\n    function _updateSecret(uint256 newSecret) private {\n        secretKey = newSecret;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n\n### 1. Overusing Public Functions\n```solidity\n// Bad: All functions unnecessarily public\ncontract BadExample {\n    uint256 public value;\n    \n    function _helper() public pure returns (uint256) {\n        return 1;\n    }\n}\n\n// Good:",

Public variables expose data via getters, so use cautiously.\n- **Gas Efficiency**: `external` functions save gas for external calls compared to `public`. For variables, public getters add minor gas overhead.\n- **Conventions**: Prefix internal or private functions with `_` (e.g., `_mint`) to signal they're not user-facing.\n- **ERC-20 Context**: In tokens like USDC or DAI, `public` is used for balances and allowances to enable transparency, while `_mint` and `_burn` are internal to restrict minting/burning to authorized contracts.",
