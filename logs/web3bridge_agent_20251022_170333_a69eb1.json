For solidity, the declared types have default values called \"zero states,\" with the default for most variables being zero, except for boolean which defaults to false.\n\nSolidity has both \"value types\" and \"reference types.\" Value types store their own data and are passed by value, meaning they are copied when used in function arguments or assignments.\n\nBoolean and Integer as examples of value types in Solidity. A boolean stores true or false values with a default of false, while integer types are used to store numerical values, including signed integers.Unsigned integers only hold positive values, while signed integers can hold both positive and negative values.\n\nAnother value type in solidity is address, which used to hold a 20-byte value representing an Ethereum wallet address. This can be used to get or transfer balances.\n\nThere are differences between bytes and strings. Bytes store a fixed-sized character set and are less expensive in smart contracts compared to strings, which can store character sets equal to or more than a byte.\n\nHowever, strings have dynamic lengths and consume more gas when transported from the front end to the smart contract, making bytes preferable for data with known lengths due to their lower gas consumption.",

They save gas by avoiding storage costs.\n- *Immutable*: Variables marked as immutable are set during contract deployment (e.g., in the constructor) and cannot be modified afterward. They are also gas-efficient.\n\n## Other Key Concepts\n- *Constructor*: A special function",

Inheritance is a core feature of Solidity that allows one contract to inherit functions and variables from another. It helps make smart contracts more modular, reusable, and easier to manage.\n\n### Types of Inheritance\n\nThere are different types of inheritance in Solidity:\n\n1. **Single Inheritance** \u2013 where one contract inherits from one parent\n2. **Multi-Level Inheritance** \u2013 where a contract inherits from a parent, which itself inherited from another contract\n3. **Hierarchical Inheritance** \u2013 where multiple contracts inherit from the same base contract\n4. **Multiple Inheritance** \u2013 where a contract inherits from two or more parent contracts\n\n### Key Rules I Learned\n\n- Only `public` and `internal` members can be inherited\n- A derived contract can override functions from a base contract, but the function signatures must match exactly\n- The `super` keyword or the base contract name can be used to call parent functions\n- In multiple inheritance, `super` calls are resolved based on the most derived contract\n\n### My Takeaway\n\nThis topic helped me understand how Solidity supports clean and scalable contract development through inheritance.",
