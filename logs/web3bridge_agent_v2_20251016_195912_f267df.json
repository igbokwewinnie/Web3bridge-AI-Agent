              "chunk": "### Summary\n\nIn summary, I learned what Solidity is and how it handles different types of data. **Value types** store actual data and are copied when used. These include:\n\n- `bool` (true or false)  \n- `int` and `uint` (for numbers)  \n- `address` (for Ethereum addresses)  \n- `bytes` (fixed-size binary data)  \n- `string` (text)  \n- `enum` (custom options)\n\nOn the other hand, **reference types** store a pointer to the data, meaning changes to one variable can affect another if they point to the same place. These include:\n\n- `arrays`  \n- `strings`  \n- `structs` (custom data groups)  \n- `mappings` (key-value pairs)\n\n\n### About Smart Contract\n\nI learned what a smart contract is and how its structure works in Solidity. A smart contract is like a program stored on the blockchain. It holds both data (called **state variables**) and logic (called **functions**).\n\nSome key things I learnt from the sample smart contract that was used in class were:\n\n- **SPDX-License Identifier**: A comment at the top that mentions the license type (not required, but recommended).\n- **Pragma**: Tells the Solidity compiler which version to use.\n- **Semicolons** are mandatory in Solidity.\n- **Contracts** in Solidity are similar to classes in other languages. They bundle variables and functions together.\n- **State variables** are stored on the blockchain.\n- **Functions** define actions the contract can take. Functions have return types and can be visible to the public or private to the contract.\n\n---\n\n### I also learned about variable scope in Solidity:\n\n- **State variables**: Stored permanently on the blockchain.\n- **Local variables**: Exist temporarily during function execution.\n- **Global variables**: Built-in values provided by Solidity, like block time or sender address.\n\n---\n\n### Then I learned about visibility specifiers:\n\n- `public`: Anyone can access (inside or outside the contract).\n- `private`: Only within the same contract.\n- `internal`: Same contract or child contracts.\n- `external`: C",

They\u2019re useful for interacting with external contracts like ERC-20 tokens.\n- **Abstract Contracts** act as templates with unimplemented functions and optional logic. They must be inherited and completed by another contract.\n\n---\n\n## Error Handling in Solidity\n\nSolidity provides built-in methods for error handling:\n\n- `require()`: Checks a condition and reverts with a message if false. Best for input validation.\n- `revert()`: Used for custom errors and can be more gas-efficient.\n\n---\n\nThank you.",
