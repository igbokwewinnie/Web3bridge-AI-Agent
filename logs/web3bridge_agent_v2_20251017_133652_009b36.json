However, there are specific challenges that you might encounter when using this feature, such as configuring dependencies or debugging issues. According to the documentation in [README.md](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Web3bridge-Web3-Cohort-XIII-main/blob/main/online-program/submissions/week-3/day-2/Nnaji-Benjamin/README.md), you may need to configure environment variables such as `PRIVATE_KEY_1`, `TEST_API_KEY`, and `LISK_SCAN_API_KEY` before using the Hardhat Ignition module. Additionally, you may need to troubleshoot issues related to deploying contracts or testing, such as ensuring that your private key and API keys are correct and that your contract source code is correctly compiled and deployed.\n\nTo address these challenges, you can refer to the documentation in [README.md](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Web3bridge-Web3-Cohort-XIII-main/blob/main/online-program/submissions/week-3/day-2/jvcbyte-storage/README.md), which provides step-by-step instructions on how to install dependencies, compile contracts, run tests, and deploy contracts using the Hardhat Ignition module. You can also try running tasks such as `npx hardhat help`, `npx hardhat test`, and `npx hardhat node` to better understand the Hardhat workflow and troubleshoot issues.",
