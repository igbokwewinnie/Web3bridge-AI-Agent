Solidity supports multiple inheritance, meaning a single contract can inherit from more than one parent contract.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Basic Inheritance\n- Solidity supports multiple inheritance using the `is` keyword\n- Child contracts inherit all public and internal functions, state variables, and modifiers from parent contracts\n- Inheritance creates an \"is-a\" relationship between contracts\n\n### Function Overriding Rules\n- **Parent functions** that can be overridden must be marked as `virtual`\n- **Child functions** that override parent functions must use the `override` keyword\n- When overriding functions from multiple parents, specify all parent contracts: `override(Parent1, Parent2)`\n\n### Inheritance Order - Critical Rule\n- Parent contracts must be listed from \"most base-like\" to \"most derived\"\n- This follows the C3 linearization algorithm\n- Incorrect ordering will cause compilation errors\n\n## Method Resolution Order (MRO)\n\nWhen a function exists in multiple parent contracts, Solidity searches:\n1. **Right to left** through the inheritance list\n2. **Depth-first** manner through the inheritance hierarchy\n\n### Example from the code:\n```solidity\ncontract D is B, C {  // C is rightmost\n    function foo() public pure override(B, C) returns (string memory) {\n        return super.foo();  // Returns \"C\"\n    }\n}\n\ncontract E is C, B {  // B is rightmost  \n    function foo() public pure override(C, B) returns (string memory) {\n        return super.foo();  // Returns \"B\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## The `super` Keyword\n\n- `super.functionName()` calls the function from the next contract in the MRO\n- It doesn't necessarily call the immediate parent - it follows the linearization order\n- Useful for extending functionality rather than completely replacing it\n\n## Inheritance Hierarchy Example\n\n```\n    A (base)\n   / \\\n  B   C  \n / \\ /\n",

The Solidity support in VS Code is provided by extensions such as Solidity, OpenZeppelin, and others.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that Remix is often used as a sandbox environment for smart contract development and deployment, and many developers find it to be a more convenient and user-friendly option.\n\nThat being said, if you prefer to use VS Code, you can still do so and have a more traditional development experience. You will need to install the Solidity extension and a Solidity compiler, and then you can write, compile, and deploy your smart contracts from within VS Code.\n\n*Source:* [onsite-program/tasks/week-6/smart-contract-week-task-1.md](https://github.com/Bloceducare/Web3bridge-Web3-Cohort-XIII/blob/main/onsite-program/tasks/week-6/smart-contract-week-task-1.md), [online-program/tasks/week-6/smart-contract-week-task-1.md](https://github.com/Bloceducare/Web3bridge-Web3-Cohort-XIII/blob/main/online-program/tasks/week-6/smart-contract-week-task-1.md), [online-program/submissions/week-3/day-5/jvcbyte/summary-of-inheritance.md](https://github.com/Bloceducare/Web3bridge-Web3-Cohort-XIII/blob/main/online-program/submissions/week-3/day-5/jvcbyte/summary-of-inheritance.md), [onsite-program/live-coding/week-4/day-5/Interface-code/README.md](https://github.com/Bloceducare/Web3bridge-Web3-Cohort-XIII/blob/main/onsite-program/live-coding/week-4/day-5/Interface-code/README.md)",
