This allows the compiler to catch errors and assign default values. For instance, a boolean defaults to false, and numbers default to zero.\n\nThere are two main categories of data types in Solidity:\n\nValue types hold their data directly. When passed to a function or assigned to another variable, they are copied. These include booleans (true/false), integers (int for signed, uint for unsigned values), addresses (20-byte Ethereum wallet identifiers), and enums (named constants like Pending, Approved, Rejected). bytes and string types are used to store characters, with bytes being more gas-efficient for fixed-length data, while string is used for dynamic text, though it consumes more gas.\n\nReference types store data by reference, not by value. If two variables reference the same data, changes to one affect the other. Reference types include arrays (fixed or dynamic), strings (which are essentially arrays of characters), structs (custom groupings of related data like a student\u2019s name, age, and grade), and mappings (key-value data structures used for things like tracking token balances by wallet address).\n\nA Solidity smart contract is similar to a class in object-oriented programming. It\u2019s compiled into bytecode and deployed to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) becaus the EVM understand only bytecode, it doesn't understand solidity code directly.

These include:\n\n- `bool` (true or false)  \n- `int` and `uint` (for numbers)  \n- `address` (for Ethereum addresses)  \n- `bytes` (fixed-size binary data)  \n- `string` (text)  \n- `enum` (custom options)\n\nOn the other hand, **reference types** store a pointer to the data, meaning changes to one variable can affect another if they point to the same place. These include:\n\n- `arrays`  \n- `strings`  \n- `structs` (custom data groups)  \n- `mappings` (key-value pairs)\n\n\n### About Smart Contract\n\nI learned what a smart contract is and how its structure works in Solidity. A smart contract is like a program stored on the blockchain. It holds both data (called **state variables**) and logic (called **functions**).\n\nSome key things I learnt from the sample smart contract that was used in class were:\n\n- **SPDX-License Identifier**: A comment at the top that mentions the license type (not required, but recommended).\n- **Pragma**: Tells the Solidity compiler which version to use.\n- **Semicolons** are mandatory in Solidity.\n- **Contracts** in Solidity are similar to classes in other languages. They bundle variables and functions together.\n- **State variables** are stored on the blockchain.\n- **Functions** define actions the contract can take. Functions have return types and can be visible to the public or private to the contract.\n\n---\n\n### I also learned about variable scope in Solidity:\n\n- **State variables**: Stored permanently on the blockchain.\n- **Local variables**: Exist temporarily during function execution.\n- **Global variables**: Built-in values provided by Solidity, like block time or sender address.\n\n---\n\n### Then I learned about visibility specifiers:\n\n- `public`: Anyone can access (inside or outside the contract).\n- `private`: Only within the same contract.\n- `internal`: Same contract or child contracts.\n- `external`: C",
