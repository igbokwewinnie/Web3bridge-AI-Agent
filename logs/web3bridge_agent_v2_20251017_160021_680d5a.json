These hashes will be your leaf nodes.\n\n3. **Construct the Tree**:\n\n   - Combine the hashes of the first two blocks and hash the result to create the first non-leaf node.\n   - Repeat the process for the next two blocks.\n   - Finally, combine the two non-leaf node hashes and hash the result to create the root hash.\n\n4. **Visual Representation**:\n   - Draw a simple diagram of your Merkle Tree, labeling all nodes (leaf and non-leaf) with their corresponding hashes.\n\n### Part 3: Verification\n\n1. **Verify Integrity**:\n\n   - Assume one of the data blocks (e.g., \"Block3\") has been tampered with. Show how the root hash changes and explain why this is important for data integrity in blockchain.\n\n2. **Write-Up**:\n   - Write a short explanation (100-150 words) on how Merkle Trees help in verifying data integrity in blockchain systems."

Adding Tasks\n\n- Navigate to the **tasks/week-<week_number>/** folder.\n- Create a markdown file named `Day-<day_number>-task.md`.\n- Provide clear instructions and expectations.\n- Commit and push your changes.\n\nExample:\n\n```bash\ngit add tasks/week-1/Day-1-task.md\ngit commit -m \"Add Week 1 Day 1 Merkle Tree Task\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n### 2. Preparing the Submission Folder\n\n- Navigate to the **submissions/week-<week_number>/** folder.\n- If a task is given for a specific day, create a corresponding **day subfolder** (`day-<day_number>/`).\n- Example:\n  submissions/week-3/day-2/\n\n- Students will submit inside this subfolder using their **Registered Name** and **Project Name** as their personal directory.\n- Example:\n  submissions/week-3/day-2/JohnDoe-Merkle-Tree/\n\n### 3. Reviewing Student Submissions\n\n- Check the Pull Re",
