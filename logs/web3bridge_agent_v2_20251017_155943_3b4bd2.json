These hashes will be your leaf nodes.\n\n3. **Construct the Tree**:\n\n   - Combine the hashes of the first two blocks and hash the result to create the first non-leaf node.\n   - Repeat the process for the next two blocks.\n   - Finally, combine the two non-leaf node hashes and hash the result to create the root hash.\n\n4. **Visual Representation**:\n   - Draw a simple diagram of your Merkle Tree, labeling all nodes (leaf and non-leaf) with their corresponding hashes.\n\n### Part 3: Verification\n\n1. **Verify Integrity**:\n\n   - Assume one of the data blocks (e.g., \"Block3\") has been tampered with. Show how the root hash changes and explain why this is important for data integrity in blockchain.\n\n2. **Write-Up**:\n   - Write a short explanation (100-150 words) on how Merkle Trees help in verifying data integrity in blockchain systems."
