According to [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-solidity-handbook/#heading-how-to-declare-variables-and-functions-in-solidity), in Solidity, visibility means \"the ability of a piece of code to be seen and accessed by another piece of code\". How I understand this is, visibility in solidity refers to how a piece of code is seen and accessible by another piece of code. These visiibilities are basically attributed to variables or functions to determine how these variables or functions can be seen and accessed. There are just four (4) visibility specifiers in Solidity and they are: public, internal, external, and private.\n\n```bash\n    Public functions and variables can be accessed in:\n    1. Inside the contract\n    2. Outside the contract\n    3. From other smart contracts\n    4. From external accounts... basically, can be accessed everywhere.\n```\n\n    ### For example  `string public publicVar = \"I am public\";\n\n        Here, this is a variable with the name publicVar.\n        That variable is a string.\n        That variable can be accessed everywhere.\n\n---\n\n```bash\n    Private functions and variables can be accessed in:\n    1. Only within the smart contact that declares them.\n```\n\n    ### For example  `string private privateVar = \"I am private\";\n\n        Here, this is a variable with the name privateVar.\n        That variable is a string.\n        That variable can only be accessed within the smart contract.\n\n---\n\n```bash\n    Internal functions and variables are similar to private visibility can be accessed in:\n    1. Only within the smart contact that declares them.\n    2. They can also be accessed from deived contacts (e.g child contracts)\n```\n\n    ### For example  `string internal internalVar = \"I ",

              "content": "# What I Learned in Solidity Yesterday: Data Types, Variables & Smart Contract Basics\n\nIn yesterday\u2019s class, we focused on the fundamentals of **Solidity**, the programming language used to develop smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. We studied **data types**, how **variables** work, and how **smart contracts** are structured\u2014all essential topics for building decentralized applications (dApps).\n\n## Solidity Basics\n\nSolidity is **statically typed**, meaning every variable must have its data type explicitly declared. This helps the compiler catch errors early and assign default values. For example:\n\n- A `bool` defaults to `false`\n- Numbers (`int` or `uint`) default to `0`\n\n---\n\n## Data Types in Solidity\n\nSolidity has two main categories of data types:\n\n### 1. Value Types\n\nThese hold their data directly and are copied when assigned or passed to functions. They include:\n\n- `bool`: `true` or `false`\n- `int` / `uint`: Signed and unsigned integers\n- `address`: 20-byte Ethereum wallet address\n- `enum`: Named constants like `Pending`, `Approved`, `Rejected`\n- `bytes`: Fixed-size raw data\n- `string`: Dynamic-length text (less gas-efficient than `bytes`)\n\n### 2. Reference Types\n\nThese store data by reference. If two variables point to the same data, changes to one affect the other. They include:\n\n- `arrays`: Fixed or dynamic-length lists\n- `strings`: Essentially arrays of characters\n- `structs`: Custom groupings (e.g., student info with `name`, `age`, `grade`)\n- `mappings`: Key-value store (e.g., tracking token balances by wallet address)\n\n---\n\n## Smart Contract Structure\n\nA Solidity contract is similar to a **class** in object-oriented programming. It\u2019s compiled into **bytecode** because the **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** can only understand bytecode\u2014not raw Solidity code.\n\n### Key Elements:\n\n- **SPDX License Identifier**: Declares licensing terms\n- **`pragma` Directive**: Specifies the Solidity compiler version\n- **`contract` Keyword**: Starts the contract declar",
