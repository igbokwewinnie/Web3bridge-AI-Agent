          "content": "The program will handle the verification of data integrity in blockchain through the use of Merkle Trees. This is a data structure that allows for the efficient verification of data integrity by hashing each block of data and storing the resulting hashes in a tree-like structure. If one of the data blocks is tampered with, the hash of that block will change, which will propagate up the Merkle Tree and ultimately change the root hash. This makes it possible to immediately detect any changes to the data by comparing the root hash.\n\nAccording to the [Merkle Tree submission](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Web3bridge-Web3-Cohort-XIII-main/blob/main/online-program/submissions/week-3/day-2/Semilore-White-Merkle-Tree/verification.md), \"If one of the data blocks, such as Block3, is tampered with, the hash of Block3 will change. This change will propagate up the Merkle Tree, altering the non-leaf node hashes and ultimately changing the root hash. This is important for data integrity in blockchain because any change in the data will be immediately detectable by comparing the root hash, ensuring the data remains secure and unaltered.\"\n\nAdditionally, the program will teach best practices for keeping applications secure. According to the [Internal Submission](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Web3bridge-Web3-Cohort-XIII-main/blob/main/onsite-program/submissions/week-3/day-3/README.md), \"Accessible within the contract and from derived (child) contracts. Not accessible externally.\" This implies that functions and variables should be properly scoped to prevent external access and minimize potential security risks.\n\nAs for specific best practices, the program emphasizes the importance of writing clean, tested, and well-documented code, as seen in the [Practice writing smart contract](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Web3bridge-Web3-Cohort-XIII-main/blob/main/onsite-program/tasks/week-5/day-4.md) task. The program also highlights the need for proper security measures, such as multi-signature wallets, as seen in the [Multi signature smart contract](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Web3bridge-Web3-Cohort-XIII-main/blob/main/onsite-program/tasks/week-5/day-5.md) task.\n\nOverall, the program places a strong emphasis on data integrity and security, providing guidance on how to ensure the integrity of blockchain data and how to write secure smart contracts.",
