Based on the course material, it's essential to note that Web3 is a vast and rapidly evolving field, and mastering it requires consistent practice, patience, and persistence.\n\nAs a rough estimate, the course material suggests that students can expect to spend around 10-16 hours per week on tasks, assignments, and learning activities. However, this is just an estimate and may vary depending on individual circumstances.\n\nTo give you a better idea, here are some guidelines on the expected time commitment for different activities:\n\n* Task completion: 6-10 hours/week\n* Learning and practice: 2-4 hours/week\n* Peer feedback and discussion: 1-2 hours/week\n* Live sessions and Q&A: 1-2 hours/week\n\nPlease note that these are rough estimates, and you should adjust them according to your personal pace and needs. It's also essential to maintain a balance between coursework, personal projects, and self-study to ensure a comprehensive understanding of Web3 concepts.\n\nFor more details, check [Week-5/day-4.md](https://github.com/Bloceducare/Web3bridge-Web3-Cohort-XIII-main/blob/main/onsite-program/tasks/week-5/day-4.md). \nIn addition, I recommend checking the course schedule and milestones to get a better understanding of the expected time commitment for each week.",
