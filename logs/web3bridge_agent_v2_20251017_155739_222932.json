This web3 help us to own our work and give us more access. it involve smart contracts which are written in solidity and other languages. \n\nSolidity is a programming language that helps us build smart contracts, it enables us to interact with the Ethereum virtual machine and many others layer 2. To fully understand Solidity we would look at its visible specifiers.\n\nThis guide explains visibility specifiers in Solidity, which control who can access variables and functions in a smart contract.\n\n# Overview\n\nVisibility Specifiers determine who we can see and interact with, inside a smart contracts. It involves the variables and functions which set a simple way about where and how different parts of the smart contract can be accessed or used. Think of them as defining the boundaries or borders of your smart contract\u2019s data and actions, making sure that only the right people or other parts of the contract can access or change certain information. This helps keep your contract secure and organized, so it works exactly as intended.\n\nVisibility specifiers define how data (variables) and actions (functions) in a smart contract can be accessed. There are four types which are Public, Private, Internal, and External.\n\n# Visibility Types\n\n1.\tPublic: It is open to everyone, even external users, other contracts, and the contract itself can access and use it. Like a water borne hole in a community, anyone can read public variables or call public functions.\n\n2.\tPrivate: It is personalized, only the contract itself can access. Like a locked safe to keep your items when entering a bank, private variables and functions are hidden from external users and inherited contracts.\n\n3.\tInternal: Accessible by the contract and its children (inherited contracts). Like a family room, only the contract and its derived contracts can use internal variables or functions.\n\n4.\tExterna",

In Solidity, it implies transparency of various parts of a smart contract or a piece of code thereby making these parts accessible by another piece of code or program.\n\n## Solidity Visibility Specifiers\n\nA variable in Solidity is a container, state or value holder that when initialized, causes a change to that smart contract (e.g transactions, signing, or any other task that can be done on a smart contract).\n\nA function is an executable piece of code that performs a task once called. The function holds variables known as state values, and returns a value of any type (available in solidity) as a response after its execution.\n\nIn solidity, there are **4 different visibility specifiers** and they affect both functions and variables alike. They determine the extent to which a function or variable can be accessed from outside the region of code where it was is initialized.\n\nThere are:\n\n1. **public** visibility specifier\n\n2. **private** visibility specifier\n\n3. **external** visibility specifier\n\n4. **internal** visibility specifier\n\n### Public Visibility Specifier\n\nIn solidity, variables and functions that are specified as publicly visible are accessible anywhere in the contract they were declared in, and also outside by other contracts.\n\nThey are declared with a  `public` keyword, and this signifies to the compiler that their scope should be made global within the contract.\n\n**NOTE:** When a storage variable is given public visibility, Solidity automatically creates an implicit getter function for that variable's value which can be used by other contracts to interact with that public variable.\n\n### Private Visibility Specifier\n\nIn Solidity, variables and functions that are specified as `private` are only accessible within the contract they are defined in. They cannot be accessed by other contracts, even if they inherit fr",

              "chunk": "### SUMMARY OF SOLIDITY VISIBILITY SPECIFIERS.\n\n **Visibility specifiers** define **how and where** state variables and functions can be accessed. They help control the **security**, **accessibility**, and **behavior** of a contract.\n\n### The 4 Visibility types in Solidity are:\n- `Public`\n- `External`\n- `Internal`\n- `Private`\n\n---\n- `Public`: The Public visibility allows maximum accessibility by everyone. Both internal (within the same contract and derived contracts) and external (outside contracts and external users via transactions) entities can access public functions and variables.\n\n- `External`: The external visibility is used only for functions (not variables). Functions marked as external can be called from outside the contract only either through transactions or by other contracts. This specifier is generally used to optimize for external access, especially in contracts designed to interact with users or other smart contracts.\n\n- `Internal`: The internal visibility restricts access to only the current contract and contracts that inherit from it. It is the default visibility for functions and variables if no specifier is explicitly defined. The functions and variables marked as internal are not accessible externally, meaning they cannot be invoked through transactions or by unrelated contracts. This specifier is typically used for reusable logic or internal data structures meant to be inherited and reused in child contracts.\n\n- `Private`: The private visibility is the most restrictive. Functions and variables marked as private are only accessible within the contract in which they are defined. Even derived (inheriting) contracts cannot access them. This specifier is ideal for ensuring that sensitive logic or data cannot be altered or accessed from outside the contract's own scope. It promotes strong encapsulation and protects against unintentional interaction or misuse.",
