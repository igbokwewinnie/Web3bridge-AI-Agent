It enables code reuse, modularity, and the creation of complex systems by building on top of existing contracts.\nAnd unlike in some other programming languages solidity allows us to use multiple inheritance i.e one child contract can have multiple parents.\n\nwe can spot this using the keyword `is` .\n\n## How Inheritance Works\n\n- **Base Contract:** The contract whose properties and functions are inherited.\n- **Derived Contract:** The contract that inherits from the base contract.\n\nA derived contract can access all non-private state variables and functions of its base contract. \n\n### Syntax Example\n\n```solidity\n//Parent Contract(base coontract)\ncontract A {\n    string public constant A_NAME = \"A\";\n\n    function getName() public pure returns (string memory) {\n        return A_NAME;\n    }\n}\n//child contract(derived contract)\ncontract B is A {\n    string public constant B_NAME = \"B\";\n}\n```\n\n## Key Points\n\n- **Visibility:** Only functions and variables marked as `public` or `internal` are accessible to derived contracts. `private` members are not inherited.\n- **Override:** Derived contracts can override functions from base contracts using the `override` and `virtual` keywords.\n- **Multiple Inheritance:** Solidity uses C3 Linearization (Method Resolution Order) to handle multiple inheritance and resolve conflicts.\n\n### Example of Function Override\n\n```solidity\ncontract A {\n    function foo() public virtual pure returns (string memory) {\n        return \"A\";\n    }\n}\n\ncontract B is A {\n    function foo() public override pure returns (string memory) {\n        return \"B\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIt is also important to note that you only need to override a function if the name and the signature are identical.\n\nAlso, i learnt function modifiers are inheritable\n\n## Inheritance with Constructor Parameters\n\nSome constructors specify input paramete",

Inheritance is a core feature of Solidity that allows one contract to inherit functions and variables from another. It helps make smart contracts more modular, reusable, and easier to manage.\n\n### Types of Inheritance\n\nThere are different types of inheritance in Solidity:\n\n1. **Single Inheritance** \u2013 where one contract inherits from one parent\n2. **Multi-Level Inheritance** \u2013 where a contract inherits from a parent, which itself inherited from another contract\n3. **Hierarchical Inheritance** \u2013 where multiple contracts inherit from the same base contract\n4. **Multiple Inheritance** \u2013 where a contract inherits from two or more parent contracts\n\n### Key Rules I Learned\n\n- Only `public` and `internal` members can be inherited\n- A derived contract can override functions from a base contract, but the function signatures must match exactly\n- The `super` keyword or the base contract name can be used to call parent functions\n- In multiple inheritance, `super` calls are resolved based on the most derived contract\n\n### My Takeaway\n\nThis topic helped me understand how Solidity supports clean and scalable contract development through inheritance.",

It's like how children inherit traits from their parents - a **child contract** (derived/subclass) receives properties and behaviors from a **parent contract**.\n\n## Key Benefits\n\n- **Code Reuse**: Instead of rewriting the same code, contracts can inherit existing functionality\n- **Extensibility**: Child contracts can build upon parent contracts while adding their own features\n- **Organization**: Creates a hierarchy of related contracts with shared functionality\n\n## How Inheritance Works\n\n### Basic Syntax\n```solidity\ncontract Parent {\n    string public name = \"Parent\";\n    \n    function getName() public pure returns (string memory) {\n        return \"Parent Contract\";\n    }\n}\n\ncontract Child is Parent {\n    // Child automatically has access to Parent's variables and functions\n    string public childName = \"Child\";\n}\n```\n\nThe `is` keyword establishes the inheritance relationship.\n\n## Multiple Inheritance\n\nUnlike some languages (like Java), Solidity supports **multiple inheritance** - one child contract can inherit from multiple parent contracts:\n\n```solidity\ncontract Child is ParentA, ParentB {\n    // Inherits from both ParentA and ParentB\n}\n```\n\n## Function Overriding\n\nChild contracts can modify (override) parent functions:\n\n### Requirements for Overriding:\n1. Parent function must be marked `virtual`\n2. Child function must be marked `override`\n3. Function name and signature must be identical\n\n```solidity\ncontract Parent {\n    function getName() public virtual returns (string memory) {\n        return \"Parent\";\n    }\n}\n\ncontract Child is Parent {\n    function getName() public pure override returns (string memory) {\n        return \"Child\";  // Completely different implementation\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Function Overloading vs Overriding\n\n- **Overriding**: Same function name AND ",

These are treated as entirely separate functions and don't need special keywords.\n\n#### Solidity supports multiple inheritance, meaning one contract can inherit from several contracts\n\n#### When a contract inherits from others, the compiler flattens the entire inheritance chain into a single compiled contract on-chain.

          "content": "Defining a child contract that inherits from a parent contract in Solidity involves several key considerations and best practices. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1.  **Understanding Inheritance**: In Solidity, inheritance enables one contract to acquire the properties and functions of another contract. It is a powerful tool for code reuse, modularity, and extensibility.\n\n2.  **Syntax**: The `is` keyword is used to establish the inheritance relationship between two contracts. For instance, `contract Child is Parent` means that `Child` inherits from `Parent`.\n\n3.  **Multiple Inheritance**: Solidity supports multiple inheritance, allowing one child contract to inherit from multiple parent contracts. This is done using a comma-separated list of parent contracts after the `is` keyword.\n\n    ```solidity\ncontract Child is ParentA, ParentB {\n    // Inherits from both ParentA and ParentB\n}\n```\n\n4.  **Function Overriding**: Child contracts can modify functions inherited from parents. To override a function, it must have the same name and signature as the parent function. In the child contract, the function must be marked as `override`.\n\n    ```solidity\ncontract Parent {\n    function getName() public virtual returns (string memory) {\n        return \"Parent\";\n    }\n}\n\ncontract Child is Parent {\n    function getName() public override returns (string memory) {\n        return \"Child\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\n5.  **Best Practices**: \n    *   Only use inheritance when it makes sense from a logical and design perspective.\n    *   Keep your contracts lean and focused on their specific function.\n    *   Avoid deep inheritance hierarchies, as this can lead to complexity and debugging issues.\n\nHere's an example of a child contract that inherits from a parent contract:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract Parent {\n    string public name;\n\n    function getName() public pure returns (string memory) {\n        return \"Parent\";\n    }\n\n    function setName(string memory newName) public {\n        name = newName;\n    }\n}\n\ncontract Child is Parent {\n    // Child contract inherits from Parent\n    string public childName;\n\n    function getChildName() public view returns (string memory) {\n        return childName;\n    }\n\n    function setChildName(string memory newChildName) public {\n        childName = newChildName;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Child` contract inherits from the `Parent` contract, gaining access to its functions and variables. However, the child contract also introduces its own state variable `childName` and its own functions `getChildName` and `setChildName`.",
