Introduction\n    In Solidity, visibility specifiers define how and where variables and functions can be accessed within a smart contract, from other contracts, or externally (e.g., by users or other contracts). They are essential for hiding logic, securing data, and ensuring proper contract interactions. Solidity provides four visibility specifiers: public, private, internal, and external.\n    These specifiers apply to:\n\n    State variables: Persistent data stored on the blockchain.\n    Functions: Logic or methods within the contract.\n\n2.  Visibility Specifiers for State Variables\n    State variables are data stored on the blockchain, and their visibility determines who can read or modify them.\n\n2.1 Public\nDescription: Variables declared as `public` are accessible from anywhere. Solidity automatically generates a getter function for `public` state variables, allowing external accounts or contracts to read their values.\n\nAccess: Inside the contract, derived contracts, other contracts, and external accounts (e.g., via a transaction or frontend like ethers.js).\n\n2.2 Private\n\nDescription: Variables declared as `private` are only accessible within the contract where they are defined. They are not visible to derived contracts or external accounts.\n\nAccess: Only within the contract\u2019s functions.\n\n2.3 Internal\nDescription: Variables declared as `internal` are accessible within the contract and any contract that inherits from it (derived contracts).\n\nAccess: Inside the contract and derived contracts.\n\n2.4 External\nDescription: The `external` specifier is not applicable to state variables in Solidity. It is only used for functions. Attempting to use `external` on a variable will cause a compilation error.\n\n3.

According to [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-solidity-handbook/#heading-how-to-declare-variables-and-functions-in-solidity), in Solidity, visibility means \"the ability of a piece of code to be seen and accessed by another piece of code\". How I understand this is, visibility in solidity refers to how a piece of code is seen and accessible by another piece of code. These visiibilities are basically attributed to variables or functions to determine how these variables or functions can be seen and accessed. There are just four (4) visibility specifiers in Solidity and they are: public, internal, external, and private.\n\n```bash\n    Public functions and variables can be accessed in:\n    1. Inside the contract\n    2. Outside the contract\n    3. From other smart contracts\n    4. From external accounts... basically, can be accessed everywhere.\n```\n\n    ### For example  `string public publicVar = \"I am public\";\n\n        Here, this is a variable with the name publicVar.\n        That variable is a string.\n        That variable can be accessed everywhere.\n\n---\n\n```bash\n    Private functions and variables can be accessed in:\n    1. Only within the smart contact that declares them.\n```\n\n    ### For example  `string private privateVar = \"I am private\";\n\n        Here, this is a variable with the name privateVar.\n        That variable is a string.\n        That variable can only be accessed within the smart contract.\n\n---\n\n```bash\n    Internal functions and variables are similar to private visibility can be accessed in:\n    1. Only within the smart contact that declares them.\n    2. They can also be accessed from deived contacts (e.g child contracts)\n```\n\n    ### For example  `string internal internalVar = \"I ",

They help control the **security**, **accessibility**, and **behavior** of a contract.\n\n### The 4 Visibility types in Solidity are:\n- `Public`\n- `External`\n- `Internal`\n- `Private`\n\n---\n- `Public`: The Public visibility allows maximum accessibility by everyone. Both internal (within the same contract and derived contracts) and external (outside contracts and external users via transactions) entities can access public functions and variables.\n\n- `External`: The external visibility is used only for functions (not variables). Functions marked as external can be called from outside the contract only either through transactions or by other contracts. This specifier is generally used to optimize for external access, especially in contracts designed to interact with users or other smart contracts.\n\n- `Internal`: The internal visibility restricts access to only the current contract and contracts that inherit from it. It is the default visibility for functions and variables if no specifier is explicitly defined. The functions and variables marked as internal are not accessible externally, meaning they cannot be invoked through transactions or by unrelated contracts. This specifier is typically used for reusable logic or internal data structures meant to be inherited and reused in child contracts.\n\n- `Private`: The private visibility is the most restrictive. Functions and variables marked as private are only accessible within the contract in which they are defined. Even derived (inheriting) contracts cannot access them. This specifier is ideal for ensuring that sensitive logic or data cannot be altered or accessed from outside the contract's own scope. It promotes strong encapsulation and protects against unintentional interaction or misuse.",
