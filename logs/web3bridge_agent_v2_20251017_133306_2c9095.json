          "content": "Contract deployment processes in Hardhat involve using the Hardhat CLI tool to deploy contracts to various networks. Hardhat supports multiple networks, including local development networks, test networks, and mainnet.\n\nTo deploy a contract using Hardhat, you need to create a Hardhat configuration file (`hardhat.config.js`) that specifies the contract address, ABI, and network configuration. You can also use Hardhat's `@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers` plugin to deploy contracts programmatically.\n\nHere's an example of how to deploy a contract using Hardhat's CLI tool:\n```bash\nnpx hardhat deploy --network <network-name>\n```\nReplace `<network-name>` with the name of the network you want to deploy to, such as `localhost` or `mainnet`.\n\nAlternatively, you can use Hardhat's `@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers` plugin to deploy contracts programmatically:\n```javascript\nconst ethers = require('ethers');\nconst hardhat = require('hardhat');\n\nasync function main() {\n  const network = await hardhat.ethers.provider.getNetwork();\n  const contractfactory = await ethers.getContractFactory('MyContract');\n  const contract = await contractfactory.deploy();\n\n  // Deploy contract to the network\n  await contract.deployed();\n\n  // Get the contract address\n  const contractAddress = contract.address;\n\n  // Log the contract address\n  console.log(`Contract address: ${contractAddress}`);\n}\n\nmain().catch(console.error);\n```\nFor more details, check [onsite-program/tasks/week-6/smart-contract-week-task-1.md](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Web3bridge-Web3-Cohort-XIII-main/blob/main/onsite-program/tasks/week-6/smart-contract-week-task-1.md)",
