Efficient verification of data integrity: Merkle Trees allow for quick and secure verification of data integrity without needing to check the entire dataset.\n2. Secure data structure: Merkle Trees consist of leaf nodes, which are hashes of individual data blocks, and non-leaf nodes, which are hashes of their child nodes. This structure makes it difficult for attackers to manipulate the data without being detected.\n3. Scalable: Merkle Trees can handle large datasets efficiently, making them suitable for use in blockchain applications.\n\nFor more details, check [onsite-program/tasks/day-21/day-21.md](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Web3bridge-Web3-Cohort-XIII-main/blob/main/onsite-program/tasks/day-21/day-21.md)",
