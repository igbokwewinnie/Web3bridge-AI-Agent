It's designed following the **80/20 principle** - covering 20% of concepts that handle 80% of real-world needs.\n\n## \ud83c\udf93 Key Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this guide, you should understand:\n\n- \u2705 What Solidity is and how it works\n- \u2705 How to write basic smart contracts\n- \u2705 Core programming concepts in Solidity\n- \u2705 How smart contracts interact with each other\n- \u2705 Security considerations and best practices\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f Part 1: Foundations\n\n### What is Solidity?\n\n- **Object-oriented programming language** influenced by C++, JavaScript, and Python\n- **Compiled language** - converts human-readable code to bytecode for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\n- **Statically typed** - you must declare data types for all variables\n- **Used for smart contracts** - programs that run on blockchains\n\n### \ud83d\udd25 Your First Smart Contract\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.17;\n\ncontract HotFudgeSauce {\n    uint public qtyCups = 0;\n\n    function increment() public {\n        qtyCups += 1;\n    }\n\n    function decrement() public {\n        qtyCups -= 1;\n    }\n\n    function get() public view returns (uint) {\n        return qtyCups;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### \ud83d\udd11 Key Concepts from This Example:\n\n1. **License identifier** - specifies code licensing\n2. **Pragma directive** - tells compiler which version to use\n3. **Contract keyword** - like a class in OOP\n4. **State variables** - data stored permanently on blockchain\n5. **Functions** - executable code units\n6. **Visibility specifiers** - control access (public, private, etc.)\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcca Part 2: Variables and Data Types\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Variable Scopes\n\n1. **State Variables** - stored permanently on blockchain\n2. **Local Variables** - temporary, exist ",

However, the search results suggest that the Web3Bridge Cohort XIII program materials include information on Solidity programming, Ethereum, and smart contract development.\n\nTo get caught up on the basics, I would recommend starting with the Solidity Handbook - Class Discussion Guide, which covers the key learning objectives of Solidity programming, including understanding what Solidity is, how to write basic smart contracts, and core programming concepts. \n\nHere is a recommended learning path:\n\n1. Start with the Solidity Handbook - Class Discussion Guide to understand the basics of Solidity programming.\n2. Follow the learning objectives in the guide to learn more about key concepts, such as variables, data types, functions, and visibility specifiers.\n3. Practice writing simple smart contracts to solidify your understanding of the concepts.\n4. Explore the Web3Bridge Cohort XIII program materials to learn more about Ethereum, smart contract development, and blockchain technology.\n\n[LINK TITLE](https://github.com/Bloceducare/Web3bridge-Web3-Cohort-XIII-main/blob/main/online-program/submissions/week-3/day-4/Samuel-Akinyemi/solidity.md)",
