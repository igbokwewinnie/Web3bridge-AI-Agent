These include:\n\n- `bool` (true or false)  \n- `int` and `uint` (for numbers)  \n- `address` (for Ethereum addresses)  \n- `bytes` (fixed-size binary data)  \n- `string` (text)  \n- `enum` (custom options)\n\nOn the other hand, **reference types** store a pointer to the data, meaning changes to one variable can affect another if they point to the same place. These include:\n\n- `arrays`  \n- `strings`  \n- `structs` (custom data groups)  \n- `mappings` (key-value pairs)\n\n\n### About Smart Contract\n\nI learned what a smart contract is and how its structure works in Solidity. A smart contract is like a program stored on the blockchain. It holds both data (called **state variables**) and logic (called **functions**).\n\nSome key things I learnt from the sample smart contract that was used in class were:\n\n- **SPDX-License Identifier**: A comment at the top that mentions the license type (not required, but recommended).\n- **Pragma**: Tells the Solidity compiler which version to use.\n- **Semicolons** are mandatory in Solidity.\n- **Contracts** in Solidity are similar to classes in other languages. They bundle variables and functions together.\n- **State variables** are stored on the blockchain.\n- **Functions** define actions the contract can take. Functions have return types and can be visible to the public or private to the contract.\n\n---\n\n### I also learned about variable scope in Solidity:\n\n- **State variables**: Stored permanently on the blockchain.\n- **Local variables**: Exist temporarily during function execution.\n- **Global variables**: Built-in values provided by Solidity, like block time or sender address.\n\n---\n\n### Then I learned about visibility specifiers:\n\n- `public`: Anyone can access (inside or outside the contract).\n- `private`: Only within the same contract.\n- `internal`: Same contract or child contracts.\n- `external`: C",

There are:\n\nState variables: declared outside functions and stored permanently on the blockchain.\n\nLocal variables: declared inside functions and exist temporarily during execution.\n\nGlobal variables: built-in variables provided by Solidity, like msg.sender (who sent the transaction) or block.timestamp.\n\nSolidity also supports constants and immutables. Constants are assigned hardcoded values at compile time, while immutables can be set once at deployment through the constructor.\n\nThe contract lifecycle includes four stages: compile time (code becomes bytecode), construction time (constructor runs if present), deployment (bytecode is uploaded to the blockchain), and runtime (contract can now be interacted with the blockchain).\n\nInterfaces in Solidity define function signatures without implementations, allowing contracts to interact with other contracts (like ERC-20 tokens) by simply knowing the interface and address. Abstract contracts are templates with unimplemented functions and can contain other logic too. They must be inherited and completed before use.\n\nFor error handling, Solidity provides:\nrequire(): checks a condition and reverts with a message if false.
