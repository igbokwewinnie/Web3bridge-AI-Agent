Multiple inheritance refers to the ability of a derived contract to inherit data and methods from more than one parent contract. In other words, one child contract can have multiple parents.\n\n```solidity\ncontract A { /* ... */ }\ncontract B { /* ... */ }\ncontract C is A, B {\n    // Contract C inherits from both A and B\n}\n```"
