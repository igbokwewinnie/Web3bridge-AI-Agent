Multiple inheritance refers to the ability of a derived contract to inherit data and methods from more than one parent contract. In other words, one child contract can have multiple parents.\n\n```solidity\ncontract A { /* ... */ }\ncontract B { /* ... */ }\ncontract C is A, B {\n    // Contract C inherits from both A and B\n}\n```"

It enables code reuse, modularity, and the creation of complex systems by building on top of existing contracts.\nAnd unlike in some other programming languages solidity allows us to use multiple inheritance i.e one child contract can have multiple parents.\n\nwe can spot this using the keyword `is` .\n\n## How Inheritance Works\n\n- **Base Contract:** The contract whose properties and functions are inherited.\n- **Derived Contract:** The contract that inherits from the base contract.\n\nA derived contract can access all non-private state variables and functions of its base contract. \n\n### Syntax Example\n\n```solidity\n//Parent Contract(base coontract)\ncontract A {\n    string public constant A_NAME = \"A\";\n\n    function getName() public pure returns (string memory) {\n        return A_NAME;\n    }\n}\n//child contract(derived contract)\ncontract B is A {\n    string public constant B_NAME = \"B\";\n}\n```\n\n## Key Points\n\n- **Visibility:** Only functions and variables marked as `public` or `internal` are accessible to derived contracts. `private` members are not inherited.\n- **Override:** Derived contracts can override functions from base contracts using the `override` and `virtual` keywords.\n- **Multiple Inheritance:** Solidity uses C3 Linearization (Method Resolution Order) to handle multiple inheritance and resolve conflicts.\n\n### Example of Function Override\n\n```solidity\ncontract A {\n    function foo() public virtual pure returns (string memory) {\n        return \"A\";\n    }\n}\n\ncontract B is A {\n    function foo() public override pure returns (string memory) {\n        return \"B\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIt is also important to note that you only need to override a function if the name and the signature are identical.\n\nAlso, i learnt function modifiers are inheritable\n\n## Inheritance with Constructor Parameters\n\nSome constructors specify input paramete",

It's like how children inherit traits from their parents - a **child contract** (derived/subclass) receives properties and behaviors from a **parent contract**.\n\n## Key Benefits\n\n- **Code Reuse**: Instead of rewriting the same code, contracts can inherit existing functionality\n- **Extensibility**: Child contracts can build upon parent contracts while adding their own features\n- **Organization**: Creates a hierarchy of related contracts with shared functionality\n\n## How Inheritance Works\n\n### Basic Syntax\n```solidity\ncontract Parent {\n    string public name = \"Parent\";\n    \n    function getName() public pure returns (string memory) {\n        return \"Parent Contract\";\n    }\n}\n\ncontract Child is Parent {\n    // Child automatically has access to Parent's variables and functions\n    string public childName = \"Child\";\n}\n```\n\nThe `is` keyword establishes the inheritance relationship.\n\n## Multiple Inheritance\n\nUnlike some languages (like Java), Solidity supports **multiple inheritance** - one child contract can inherit from multiple parent contracts:\n\n```solidity\ncontract Child is ParentA, ParentB {\n    // Inherits from both ParentA and ParentB\n}\n```\n\n## Function Overriding\n\nChild contracts can modify (override) parent functions:\n\n### Requirements for Overriding:\n1. Parent function must be marked `virtual`\n2. Child function must be marked `override`\n3. Function name and signature must be identical\n\n```solidity\ncontract Parent {\n    function getName() public virtual returns (string memory) {\n        return \"Parent\";\n    }\n}\n\ncontract Child is Parent {\n    function getName() public pure override returns (string memory) {\n        return \"Child\";  // Completely different implementation\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Function Overloading vs Overriding\n\n- **Overriding**: Same function name AND ",

They can then make use of these functions without having to redefine them. For solidity, a step further is taken- functions and data of contracts can be modified! And this method is\n\nThere are two important terms\nParent Contract:- The contract whose functions will be used\nChild Contract:- The contract that inherits the functions.\n\nThe way to identify a child and parent contract is with the 'is' keyword. \n\ncontract B is A {\n    string public constant B_NAME = \"B\";\n}\n\n## Multiple Inheritance.\n\nUnlike other lanuages, solidity allows one child to have multiple parents. This means that it can inherit data and functions from more than one contract and make use of it.\n\n## Overriding\n\n You only need to **override** a function when it has **the same name and the same signature** (i.e., parameters and types) as a parent function.\n- If two functions share the same name but have different arguments, that\u2019s called **overloading**, not overriding. Solidity allows this because their signatures are different.\n\n### Example:\n```solidity\n// In contract A\nfunction getName() public pure returns (string memory) { ... }\n\n// In contract B (overload)\nfunction getName(string memory prefix) public pure returns (string memory) { ... }\n\nIf multiple contracts in an inheritance chain (A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D \u2192 E) all override the same function (e.g., getName()), the most derived version is the one that gets called\u2014meaning the one in E\n\n## Important notes\n\nYou can\u2019t declare a state variable in a child contract with the same name and type as one in a parent contract. It leads to conflicts. Instead, you can reuse and update the inherited variable\n\nLastly, Even if a contract inherits from multiple parents, only one combined contract is deployed on the blockchain.

These are treated as entirely separate functions and don't need special keywords.\n\n#### Solidity supports multiple inheritance, meaning one contract can inherit from several contracts\n\n#### When a contract inherits from others, the compiler flattens the entire inheritance chain into a single compiled contract on-chain.
