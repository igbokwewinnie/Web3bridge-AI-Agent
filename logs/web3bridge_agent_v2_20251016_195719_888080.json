Introduction\n    In Solidity, visibility specifiers define how and where variables and functions can be accessed within a smart contract, from other contracts, or externally (e.g., by users or other contracts). They are essential for hiding logic, securing data, and ensuring proper contract interactions. Solidity provides four visibility specifiers: public, private, internal, and external.\n    These specifiers apply to:\n\n    State variables: Persistent data stored on the blockchain.\n    Functions: Logic or methods within the contract.\n\n2.  Visibility Specifiers for State Variables\n    State variables are data stored on the blockchain, and their visibility determines who can read or modify them.\n\n2.1 Public\nDescription: Variables declared as `public` are accessible from anywhere. Solidity automatically generates a getter function for `public` state variables, allowing external accounts or contracts to read their values.\n\nAccess: Inside the contract, derived contracts, other contracts, and external accounts (e.g., via a transaction or frontend like ethers.js).\n\n2.2 Private\n\nDescription: Variables declared as `private` are only accessible within the contract where they are defined. They are not visible to derived contracts or external accounts.\n\nAccess: Only within the contract\u2019s functions.\n\n2.3 Internal\nDescription: Variables declared as `internal` are accessible within the contract and any contract that inherits from it (derived contracts).\n\nAccess: Inside the contract and derived contracts.\n\n2.4 External\nDescription: The `external` specifier is not applicable to state variables in Solidity. It is only used for functions. Attempting to use `external` on a variable will cause a compilation error.\n\n3.  Visibility Specifiers for Functions\n    Functions define the logic of a smart contract, and their visibility determines who can call them.\n\n3.1 Public\nDescription: Functions declared as `public` can be ca",

These specifiers are crucial for security, encapsulation, and modularity in contract design. Below is a summary of the visibility specifiers for variables and functions in Solidity (version 0.8.20), covering their meanings, use cases, and implications.\n\n## Solidity Visibility Specifiers\n\nSolidity provides four visibility specifiers: **public**, **internal**, **private**, and **external**. Each has distinct behavior for variables and functions, affecting whether they can be accessed within the contract, by derived contracts, externally by other contracts or accounts, or via transactions.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Public\n\n### Variables\n\n- **Definition:** A public state variable can be accessed from within the contract, derived contracts, other contracts, and externally (e.g., via a blockchain explorer or client).\n- **Behavior:** Solidity automatically generates a getter function for public state variables, allowing external read access. The variable can also be read and modified (if not constant or immutable) internally or by derived contracts.\n- **Gas Cost:** Getter functions for public variables incur gas costs when called externally, as they execute on-chain.\n- **Example:**\n    ```solidity\n    uint public myNumber = 42; // Accessible everywhere\n    ```\n    Accessing `myNumber` externally calls the auto-generated `myNumber()` getter.\n- **Use Case:** Use for state variables that need to be readable by users, other contracts, or dApps (e.g., token balances, contract settings).\n\n### Functions\n\n- **Definition:** A public function can be called from within the contract, by derived contracts, other contracts, or externally via transactions.\n- **Behavior:** Accessible by anyone, including external accounts (e.g., via MetaMask) and other contracts. Can read or modify state if not view or pure.\n- **",

In Solidity, it implies transparency of various parts of a smart contract or a piece of code thereby making these parts accessible by another piece of code or program.\n\n## Solidity Visibility Specifiers\n\nA variable in Solidity is a container, state or value holder that when initialized, causes a change to that smart contract (e.g transactions, signing, or any other task that can be done on a smart contract).\n\nA function is an executable piece of code that performs a task once called. The function holds variables known as state values, and returns a value of any type (available in solidity) as a response after its execution.\n\nIn solidity, there are **4 different visibility specifiers** and they affect both functions and variables alike. They determine the extent to which a function or variable can be accessed from outside the region of code where it was is initialized.\n\nThere are:\n\n1. **public** visibility specifier\n\n2. **private** visibility specifier\n\n3. **external** visibility specifier\n\n4. **internal** visibility specifier\n\n### Public Visibility Specifier\n\nIn solidity, variables and functions that are specified as publicly visible are accessible anywhere in the contract they were declared in, and also outside by other contracts.\n\nThey are declared with a  `public` keyword, and this signifies to the compiler that their scope should be made global within the contract.\n\n**NOTE:** When a storage variable is given public visibility, Solidity automatically creates an implicit getter function for that variable's value which can be used by other contracts to interact with that public variable.\n\n### Private Visibility Specifier\n\nIn Solidity, variables and functions that are specified as `private` are only accessible within the contract they are defined in.
