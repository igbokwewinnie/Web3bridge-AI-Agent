There are **four** main visibility levels:\n\n- `public`\n- `internal`\n- `private`\n- `external` (only for functions)\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd11 1. public\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 For Functions:\n\n- Can be **called from anywhere**: within the contract, from derived (child) contracts, and from external accounts or contracts.\n  _Example:_\n\n```solidity\nfunction sayHello() public pure returns (string memory) {\n    return \"Hello!\";\n}\n\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd11 2. private\n\n- *Functions & Variables:* Only accessible within the contract where they are declared. Not accessible from derived contracts or externally.\n\n*Example:*\nsolidity\nuint private secret;\n\nfunction setSecret(uint _value) private {\n    secret = _value;\n}\n\n\n---\n\n3. *Internal*\n## \ud83d\udd11 3. Internal\n\n- *Functions & Variables:* Accessible within the contract and from derived (child) contracts. Not accessible externally.\n\n*Example:*\nsolidity\nuint internal data;\n\nfunction updateData(uint _val) internal {\n    data = _val;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd11 4. External\n\n- Functions only: Can be called only from outside the contract (externally). Cannot be called internally unless via this.functionName().\n\nExample:\nsolidity\nfunction callMe() external pure returns (string memory) {\nreturn \"Hello\";\n}\n\n---\n\nSummary Table\n\n| Specifier | Contract           | Derived Contracts | External |\n| --------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | -------- |\n| public    | \u2705                 | \u2705                | \u2705       |\n| private   | \u2705                 | \u274c                | \u274c       |\n| internal  | \u2705                 | \u2705                | \u274c       |\n| external  | \u274c (only via this) | \u274c                | \u2705       |\n\n---\n\n\u2705 Created by **Maryjane Ukamaka Okafor**  \n\ud83d\udcda Web3Bridge Cohort XIII  \n\ud83d\uddd3\ufe0f Day 3 \u2013 Solidity Visibility Assignment",

These include:\n\n- `bool` (true or false)  \n- `int` and `uint` (for numbers)  \n- `address` (for Ethereum addresses)  \n- `bytes` (fixed-size binary data)  \n- `string` (text)  \n- `enum` (custom options)\n\nOn the other hand, **reference types** store a pointer to the data, meaning changes to one variable can affect another if they point to the same place. These include:\n\n- `arrays`  \n- `strings`  \n- `structs` (custom data groups)  \n- `mappings` (key-value pairs)\n\n\n### About Smart Contract\n\nI learned what a smart contract is and how its structure works in Solidity. A smart contract is like a program stored on the blockchain. It holds both data (called **state variables**) and logic (called **functions**).\n\nSome key things I learnt from the sample smart contract that was used in class were:\n\n- **SPDX-License Identifier**: A comment at the top that mentions the license type (not required, but recommended).\n- **Pragma**: Tells the Solidity compiler which version to use.\n- **Semicolons** are mandatory in Solidity.\n- **Contracts** in Solidity are similar to classes in other languages. They bundle variables and functions together.\n- **State variables** are stored on the blockchain.\n- **Functions** define actions the contract can take. Functions have return types and can be visible to the public or private to the contract.\n\n---\n\n### I also learned about variable scope in Solidity:\n\n- **State variables**: Stored permanently on the blockchain.\n- **Local variables**: Exist temporarily during function execution.\n- **Global variables**: Built-in values provided by Solidity, like block time or sender address.\n\n---\n\n### Then I learned about visibility specifiers:\n\n- `public`: Anyone can access (inside or outside the contract).\n- `private`: Only within the same contract.\n- `internal`: Same contract or child contracts.\n- `external`: C",
