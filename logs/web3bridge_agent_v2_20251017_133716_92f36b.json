Adding Tasks\n\n- Navigate to the **tasks/week-<week_number>/** folder.\n- Create a markdown file named `Day-<day_number>-task.md`.\n- Provide clear instructions and expectations.\n- Commit and push your changes.\n\nExample:\n\n```bash\ngit add tasks/week-1/Day-1-task.md\ngit commit -m \"Add Week 1 Day 1 Merkle Tree Task\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n### 2. Preparing the Submission Folder\n\n- Navigate to the **submissions/week-<week_number>/** folder.\n- If a task is given for a specific day, create a corresponding **day subfolder** (`day-<day_number>/`).\n- Example:\n  submissions/week-3/day-2/\n\n- Students will submit inside this subfolder using their **Registered Name** and **Project Name** as their personal directory.\n- Example:\n  submissions/week-3/day-2/JohnDoe-Merkle-Tree/\n\n### 3. Reviewing Student Submissions\n\n- Check the Pull Requests (PRs) tab on GitHub.\n- Open a PR and review the student\u2019s work.\n- Leave comments for corrections if needed.\n- Approve the PR if it meets expectations.\n- Merge the PR after approval.\n\nThank you for contributing to Web3Bridge Cohort XIII!
