Locate the sample contract file (e.g., `contracts/SampleContract.sol`) in the project directory.\n2.  Edit the contract code to make the desired changes (e.g., modify functions, add new logic, or fix bugs).\n3.  Re-compile the contract using the command `npx hardhat compile` to ensure the changes are updated in the compiled contract code.\n4.  Run the `npx hardhat test` command to test the modified contract and ensure that it works as expected.\n\nIt's also a good practice to use version control systems like Git to track changes and collaborate with others on the project.\n\nIf you want to deploy the modified contract to a test network or mainnet, you would use the `npx hardhat node` command to start a local node, deploy the contract using the `npx hardhat ignition deploy` command, and then interact with the deployed contract using the `npx hardhat console` command.\n\nFor more advanced deployment scenarios, you might need to use additional tools like Ethers.js or Web3.js, or modify the Hardhat configuration files (`hardhat.config.js` or `hardhat.config.ts`) to suit your needs.\n\nPlease ensure that you are following all the safety guidelines when writing and testing smart contracts, especially when deploying them to a blockchain network.\n\nYou can refer to the [sample Hardhat project](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Web3bridge-Web3-Cohort-XIII-main/blob/main/onsite-program/submissions/week-4/day-4/day4-task-1/BABALOLA_ABIODUN_AYOMIDE/README.md) for more information on how to set up and use Hardhat.\n\nHere are the relevant references:\n\n*   [Sample Hardhat Project](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Web3bridge-Web3-Cohort-XIII-main/blob/main/onsite-program/submissions/week-4/day-4/day4-task-1/BABALOLA_ABIODUN_AYOMIDE/README.md)\n*   [Storage Contract Hardhat Project](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Web3bridge-Web3-Cohort-XIII-main/blob/main/online-program/submissions/week-6/smart-contract-week-task-1.md)\n*   [Multiple Inheritance](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Web3bridge-Web3-Cohort-XIII-main/blob/main/online-program/submissions/week-3/day-5/Ifeoluwa-Sanni/Inheritance-in-Solidity.md)\n*   [Basic Hardhat Workflow](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Web3bridge-Web3-Cohort-XIII-main/blob/main/online-program/submissions/week-3/day-2/jvcbyte-storage/README.md)\n\nPlease replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.\n\nYou can check out more tasks from [Web3Bridge](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Web3bridge-Web3-Cohort-XIII-main/blob/main/) and learn more about how to deploy smart contracts using Hardhat.",
