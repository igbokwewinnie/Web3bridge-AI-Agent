I can't stress enough how understanding this distinction has been crucial for me in writing efficient and secure smart contracts.\n\n## A Brief Look Back - What I Learned About Solidity's Origins\n\nBefore diving into the technical details, I found it fascinating to learn a bit about Solidity's history and the broader context of smart contracts. Understanding where Solidity came from has helped me appreciate why it works the way it does.\n\nFrom what I've learned, Solidity was developed specifically for the Ethereum blockchain, designed to be a high-level programming language that could handle the complexities of smart contracts. Smart contracts themselves are essentially self-executing contracts where the terms are directly written into code - which means they run automatically when predetermined conditions are met, without needing intermediaries.\n\nThis background knowledge has really shaped how I think about writing code in Solidity. Every line I write isn't just regular programming - it's creating immutable, trustless agreements that will live on the blockchain. That responsibility has made me much more careful and thoughtful about my coding practices.\n\n## Value Types - My Understanding\n\nI like to think of value types as getting my very own, independent copy of a piece of information. I've come to understand them as simple, self-contained data points that I work with daily.\n\n### Value Types I Use Most:\n\n- **`bool`** - Boolean values (`true`/`false`) - I use these for simple yes/no logic\n- **`int`/`uint`** - Signed and unsigned integers - My go-to for numbers\n- **`address`** - Unique blockchain addresses - Essential for my smart contracts\n- **`bytesM`** - Fixed-size raw data - I use these for specific data storage\n- **`enum`** - Defined set of named choices - Great for my s",

For solidity, the declared types have default values called \"zero states,\" with the default for most variables being zero, except for boolean which defaults to false.\n\nSolidity has both \"value types\" and \"reference types.\" Value types store their own data and are passed by value, meaning they are copied when used in function arguments or assignments.\n\nBoolean and Integer as examples of value types in Solidity. A boolean stores true or false values with a default of false, while integer types are used to store numerical values, including signed integers.Unsigned integers only hold positive values, while signed integers can hold both positive and negative values.\n\nAnother value type in solidity is address, which used to hold a 20-byte value representing an Ethereum wallet address. This can be used to get or transfer balances.\n\nThere are differences between bytes and strings. Bytes store a fixed-sized character set and are less expensive in smart contracts compared to strings, which can store character sets equal to or more than a byte.\n\nHowever, strings have dynamic lengths and consume more gas when transported from the front end to the smart contract, making bytes preferable for data with known lengths due to their lower gas consumption.",

It runs on Ethereum Virtual Machine and it compiles human readable code to bytecode.\n\n---\n\n## Solidity Data types\nJust as we have data types in JavaScript, Solidity also has its own. But Solidity does not have the types undefined or null, instead, if you make a new variable and don\u2019t give it a value, Solidity gives it a default value which depends on its type.\n\n### Value Types vs. Reference Types\nValue types like numbers, booleans, addresses get COPIED when you use them while Reference types like arrays and structs are SHARED i.e you both point to the same thing.\nExamples of value types - uint(Numbers that can\u2019t be negative), int (numbers that can be negative), address, bool and bytes\n\n##### There are data types referred to as composite data types because they are composed from other primitive data types - structs and mappings\nStructs gives the ability to define a custom type so that can be used to  organize and collect pieces of data into one larger data type.\nmapping in Solidity is a key-value store where each key maps to a value, providing constant-time lookup. It cannot be iterated or passed as parameters externally.\n\n---\n\n## Smart contracts\nWe looked into smart contract with an example and what smart contract codes mean. e.g\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT -> This line specifies the License of the contract code\npragma solidity ^0.8.8.0; -> This is compulsory and it must be the first line of code in every solidity file because it tells the EVM which compiler version to use in compiling.\n\ncontract HotFudgeSauce {\n    uint public qtyCups;\n\n    // Get the current hot fudge quantit",
