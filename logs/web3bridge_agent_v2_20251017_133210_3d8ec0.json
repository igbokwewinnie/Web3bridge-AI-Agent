From the search results, we can see that there are tasks that involve deploying contracts using Hardhat Ignition (e.g., `npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js`).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n> To test your problem-solving skills and familiarity with Hardhat, try deploying a contract using Hardhat Ignition. You can find an example of this in the [README file of week-3/day-2/Nnaji-Benjamin](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Web3bridge-Web3-Cohort-XIII-main/blob/main/online-program/submissions/week-3/day-2/Nnaji-Benjamin/README.md).\n\nNote that you will need to modify the command to use the correct module and contract file for your specific project.",
