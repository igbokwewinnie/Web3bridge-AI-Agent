It runs on Ethereum Virtual Machine and it compiles human readable code to bytecode.\n\n---\n\n## Solidity Data types\nJust as we have data types in JavaScript, Solidity also has its own. But Solidity does not have the types undefined or null, instead, if you make a new variable and don\u2019t give it a value, Solidity gives it a default value which depends on its type.\n\n### Value Types vs. Reference Types\nValue types like numbers, booleans, addresses get COPIED when you use them while Reference types like arrays and structs are SHARED i.e you both point to the same thing.\nExamples of value types - uint(Numbers that can\u2019t be negative), int (numbers that can be negative), address, bool and bytes\n\n##### There are data types referred to as composite data types because they are composed from other primitive data types - structs and mappings\nStructs gives the ability to define a custom type so that can be used to  organize and collect pieces of data into one larger data type.\nmapping in Solidity is a key-value store where each key maps to a value, providing constant-time lookup. It cannot be iterated or passed as parameters externally.\n\n---\n\n## Smart contracts\nWe looked into smart contract with an example and what smart contract codes mean. e.g\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT -> This line specifies the License of the contract code\npragma solidity ^0.8.8.0; -> This is compulsory and it must be the first line of code in every solidity file because it tells the EVM which compiler version to use in compiling.\n\ncontract HotFudgeSauce {\n    uint public qtyCups;\n\n    // Get the current hot fudge quantit",

We studied **data types**, how **variables** work, and how **smart contracts** are structured\u2014all essential topics for building decentralized applications (dApps).\n\n## Solidity Basics\n\nSolidity is **statically typed**, meaning every variable must have its data type explicitly declared. This helps the compiler catch errors early and assign default values. For example:\n\n- A `bool` defaults to `false`\n- Numbers (`int` or `uint`) default to `0`\n\n---\n\n## Data Types in Solidity\n\nSolidity has two main categories of data types:\n\n### 1. Value Types\n\nThese hold their data directly and are copied when assigned or passed to functions. They include:\n\n- `bool`: `true` or `false`\n- `int` / `uint`: Signed and unsigned integers\n- `address`: 20-byte Ethereum wallet address\n- `enum`: Named constants like `Pending`, `Approved`, `Rejected`\n- `bytes`: Fixed-size raw data\n- `string`: Dynamic-length text (less gas-efficient than `bytes`)\n\n### 2. Reference Types\n\nThese store data by reference. If two variables point to the same data, changes to one affect the other. They include:\n\n- `arrays`: Fixed or dynamic-length lists\n- `strings`: Essentially arrays of characters\n- `structs`: Custom groupings (e.g., student info with `name`, `age`, `grade`)\n- `mappings`: Key-value store (e.g., tracking token balances by wallet address)\n\n---\n\n## Smart Contract Structure\n\nA Solidity contract is similar to a **class** in object-oriented programming. It\u2019s compiled into **bytecode** because the **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** can only understand bytecode\u2014not raw Solidity code.\n\n### Key Elements:\n\n- **SPDX License Identifier**: Declares licensing terms\n- **`pragma` Directive**: Specifies the Solidity compiler version\n- **`contract` Keyword**: Starts the contract declar",

These include booleans (true/false), integers (int for signed, uint for unsigned values), addresses (20-byte Ethereum wallet identifiers), and enums (named constants like Pending, Approved, Rejected). bytes and string types are used to store characters, with bytes being more gas-efficient for fixed-length data, while string is used for dynamic text, though it consumes more gas.\n\nReference types store data by reference, not by value.
