Introduction\n    In Solidity, visibility specifiers define how and where variables and functions can be accessed within a smart contract, from other contracts, or externally (e.g., by users or other contracts). They are essential for hiding logic, securing data, and ensuring proper contract interactions. Solidity provides four visibility specifiers: public, private, internal, and external.\n    These specifiers apply to:\n\n    State variables: Persistent data stored on the blockchain.\n    Functions: Logic or methods within the contract.\n\n2.  Visibility Specifiers for State Variables\n    State variables are data stored on the blockchain, and their visibility determines who can read or modify them.\n\n2.1 Public\nDescription: Variables declared as `public` are accessible from anywhere. Solidity automatically generates a getter function for `public` state variables, allowing external accounts or contracts to read their values.\n\nAccess: Inside the contract, derived contracts, other contracts, and external accounts (e.g., via a transaction or frontend like ethers.js).\n\n2.2 Private\n\nDescription: Variables declared as `private` are only accessible within the contract where they are defined. They are not visible to derived contracts or external accounts.\n\nAccess: Only within the contract\u2019s functions.\n\n2.3 Internal\nDescription: Variables declared as `internal` are accessible within the contract and any contract that inherits from it (derived contracts).\n\nAccess: Inside the contract and derived contracts.\n\n2.4 External\nDescription: The `external` specifier is not applicable to state variables in Solidity. It is only used for functions. Attempting to use `external` on a variable will cause a compilation error.\n\n3.  Visibility Specifiers for Functions\n    Functions define the logic of a smart contract, and their visibility determines who can call them.\n\n3.1 Public\nDescription: Functions declared as `public` can be ca",

This concept is known as **visibility**.\n\nA function\u2019s visibility can be set to **external**, **public**, **internal**, or **private**, while state variables only have three possible visibility modifiers: **public**, **internal**, or **private**. The keyword `external` is not applicable to state variables.\n\n---\n\n##  External\n\nExternal functions can only be called from **outside** the contract in which they were declared.\n\n```\ncontract MyContract {\n    function sayHello() external pure returns (string memory) {\n        return \"Hello from outside!\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n##  Public\n\nPublic functions and variables can be accessed by **all parties within and outside the contract**. When the visibility is not specified, the **default visibility of a function is `public`**.\n\n```\ncontract MyContract {\n    uint public count = 0; // Automatically creates a getter\n\n    function increment() public {\n        count++;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n---\n\n##  Internal\n\nFunctions and variables declared with the `internal` keyword are only accessible **within the contract** in which they were declared, although they can be accessed from **derived contracts**. When visibility is not specified, **state variables have the default value of `internal`**.\n\n```\ncontract Base {\n    uint internal score = 100;\n\n    function getScore() internal view returns (uint) {\n        return score;\n    }\n}\n\ncontract Child is Base {\n    function readScore() public view returns (uint) {\n        return getScore(); // allowed because it's internal\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n##  Private\n\nFunctions declared with the `private` keyword are only accessible **within the contract** in which they were declared. Private functions are also the **only functions that cannot be inherited** by other functions.\n\n```\ncontract MyContract {\n    string private secret = \"hidden\";\n\n    function getSecre",
