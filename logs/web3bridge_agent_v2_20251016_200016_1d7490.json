The best way to reason about inheritance in programming is to think of it as a way by which pieces of code \"inherit\" data and functions from other pieces of code by importing and embedding them.\n\nInheritance in Solidity also allows a developer to access, use and modify the properties (data) and functions (behaviour) of contracts that are inherited from."
