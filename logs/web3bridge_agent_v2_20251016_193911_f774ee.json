The different data - types in solidity, how to declare variables in solidity, the different variable scopes in solidity,error handling interfaces and abstract contracts and many more!\n-Now to the details,\n-    The first thing I got from the class was that solidity is a typed language, and this means that every variable - that is declared must also come with its type. For example, if you define a variable a that stores a number. You must also declare that a is number like this 'uint8 a = 12'. uint meaning unsigned integer. There are two main types in solidity and they are Value and Reference. Individually, these types have different types under them.\n- Next, I learnt about writing smart contracts in solidity and how a smart contract file can be broken down into different parts. The first being the licensing, then the pragma version, and then the body of code. For the body of the code where variables are defined, these variables have three different types which are:- state, local and global. state variables store permanent data for blockchain while local variables store temporary variables and global variables are automatic variables that come with solidity(e.g msg.sender). Just like in javascript, solidity also has constants but there is a twist, solidity has two data types known as:- constant and immutable. Constant has to be hardcoded but immutable can be defined later in constructor.\nThen, I also learnt about error handling and there are three ways :- assert,require and revert. require must be done before the function calls so that gas can be refunded.\nThere is also inheritance in solidity like other object-oriented languages and it comes in form of interface and abstract constracts. Interfaces help two smart contracts to interact with each other without copying everything, you simply copy required functions and use it.. Ab",

              "chunk": "### Summary\n\nIn summary, I learned what Solidity is and how it handles different types of data. **Value types** store actual data and are copied when used. These include:\n\n- `bool` (true or false)  \n- `int` and `uint` (for numbers)  \n- `address` (for Ethereum addresses)  \n- `bytes` (fixed-size binary data)  \n- `string` (text)  \n- `enum` (custom options)\n\nOn the other hand, **reference types** store a pointer to the data, meaning changes to one variable can affect another if they point to the same place. These include:\n\n- `arrays`  \n- `strings`  \n- `structs` (custom data groups)  \n- `mappings` (key-value pairs)\n\n\n### About Smart Contract\n\nI learned what a smart contract is and how its structure works in Solidity. A smart contract is like a program stored on the blockchain. It holds both data (called **state variables**) and logic (called **functions**).\n\nSome key things I learnt from the sample smart contract that was used in class were:\n\n- **SPDX-License Identifier**: A comment at the top that mentions the license type (not required, but recommended).\n- **Pragma**: Tells the Solidity compiler which version to use.\n- **Semicolons** are mandatory in Solidity.\n- **Contracts** in Solidity are similar to classes in other languages. They bundle variables and functions together.\n- **State variables** are stored on the blockchain.\n- **Functions** define actions the contract can take. Functions have return types and can be visible to the public or private to the contract.\n\n---\n\n### I also learned about variable scope in Solidity:\n\n- **State variables**: Stored permanently on the blockchain.\n- **Local variables**: Exist temporarily during function execution.\n- **Global variables**: Built-in values provided by Solidity, like block time or sender address.\n\n---\n\n### Then I learned about visibility specifiers:\n\n- `public`: Anyone can access (inside or outside the contract).\n- `private`: Only within the same contract.\n- `internal`: Same contract or child contracts.\n- `external`: C",
