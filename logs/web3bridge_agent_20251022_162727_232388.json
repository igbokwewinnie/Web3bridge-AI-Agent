This would cause a \"shadowing\" error.\n\n```solidity\ncontract A {\n    string author = \"Zubin\";\n}\n\ncontract B is A {\n    // This will cause a compiler error (shadowing)\n    // string author = \"Someone else\";\n}\n\ncontract C is A {\n    // This is correct - different name\n    string bookAuthor = \"Hemingway\";\n    \n    constructor() {\n        author = \"Hemingway\"; // Overriding the value\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Inheritance Hierarchy\n\nWhich version of a function will be called if a function by the same name and signature exists in a chain of inheritance? The answer is the last one \u2013 the \"most derived\" implementation in the contract hierarchy.\n\nFor inheritance chain A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D \u2192 E, if all contracts have the same function, the implementation in contract E will be called.\n\n## Constructor Inheritance\n\nWhen parent contracts have constructors with parameters, child contracts must provide those arguments. There are two methods:\n\n### Method 1: Pass arguments in inheritance declaration\n```solidity\ncontract Parent {\n    constructor(string memory _name) {\n        // Constructor logic\n    }\n}\n\ncontract Child is Parent(\"ChildName\") {\n    // Child constructor\n}\n```\n\n### Method 2: Pass arguments in child constructor\n```solidity\ncontract Child is Parent {\n    constructor(string memory _childName) Parent(_childName) {\n        // Child constructor logic\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Modifier Inheritance\n\nModifiers are also inheritable.\n\n```solidity\ncontract A {\n    address owner;\n    \n    modifier onlyOwner() {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Not the owner\");\n        _;\n    }\n}\n\ncontract B is A {\n    function restrictedFunction() public onlyOwner {\n        // This function can use the inherited modifier\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Contract Compilation and Deployment\n\nWhen a contract inh",

              "content": "# Inheritance in Solidity\n\n## What is Inheritance?\n\nInheritance is a powerful concept in Object Oriented Programming (OOP). The best way to reason about inheritance in programming is to think of it as a way by which pieces of code \"inherit\" data and functions from other pieces of code by importing and embedding them.\n\nInheritance in Solidity also allows a developer to access, use and modify the properties (data) and functions (behaviour) of contracts that are inherited from.\n\n## Key Terminology\n\n- **Derived Contract / Child Contract / Subclass**: The contract that receives this inherited material\n- **Parent Contract**: The contract whose material is made available to one or more derived contracts\n\n## Basic Inheritance Syntax\n\nYou can spot a child contract and identify its parent contract by looking for the `is` keyword.\n\n```solidity\ncontract A {\n    string constant A_NAME = \"A\";\n    \n    function getName() public view returns (string memory) {\n        return A_NAME;\n    }\n}\n\ncontract B is A {\n    string constant B_NAME = \"B\";\n    // Contract B now has access to A_NAME and getName() from Contract A\n}\n```\n\n## Multiple Inheritance\n\nUnlike some programming languages like Java, Solidity allows for multiple inheritance. Multiple inheritance refers to the ability of a derived contract to inherit data and methods from more than one parent contract. In other words, one child contract can have multiple parents.\n\n```solidity\ncontract A { /* ... */ }\ncontract B { /* ... */ }\ncontract C is A, B {\n    // Contract C inherits from both A and B\n}\n```\n\n## Function Overriding\n\n### Virtual and Override Keywords\n\nTo modify inherited functions, Solidity uses two important keywords:\n\n- **`virtual`**: This modifier allows the function to be \"overridden\" in a child contract that inherits from it. In other words, a function with the keyword virtual can be \"rewritten\" with different internal logic in another contract that inherits from this one.\n\n- **`override`**: This is the flip side to the",

The compiler effectively compiles all the other contracts and their parent contracts and so on up the entire hierarchy all into a single compiled contract (which is referred to as a \"flattened\" contract).\n\n## Benefits of Inheritance\n\n1. **Code Reuse**: Inheritance facilitates convenient and extensive code reuse \u2013 imagine a chain of application code that inherits from other code, and those in turn inherit from others and so on.\n\n2. **Modularity**: Allows breaking down complex contracts into smaller, manageable components\n\n3. **Upgradability**: Provides a foundation for creating upgradeable contract patterns\n\n4. **DRY Principle**: Follows \"Don't Repeat Yourself\" by allowing common functionality to be written once and inherited\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Mark functions as `virtual`** if you want child contracts to be able to override them\n2. **Use `override`** when implementing or chang",

In other words, a function with the keyword virtual can be \"rewritten\" with different internal logic in another contract that inherits from this one.\n\n- **`override`**: This is the flip side to the virtual modifier. When a child contract \"rewrites\" a function that was declared in a base contract (parent contract) from which it inherits, it marks that rewritten function with override to signal that its implementation overrides the one given in the parent contract.\n\n```solidity\ncontract A {\n    function getName() public virtual returns (string memory) {\n        return \"A\";\n    }\n}\n\ncontract B is A {\n    function getName() public pure override returns (string memory) {\n        return \"B\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Function Overloading vs Overriding\n\nWhen functions have identical names but different arguments, it's not an override, but an overload. And there is no conflict because the methods have different arguments, and so there is enough information in their signatures to show the compiler that they're different.\n\n```solidity\ncontract B is A {\n    // This is overloading, not overriding (different signature)\n    function getName(string memory prefix) public pure returns (string memory) {\n ",

If that smart contract is a parent contract, then its derived contracts must also pass arguments to instantiate the parent contracts. And there are two ways to do this:\n\n- **either in the statement that lists the parent contracts**\n- **Or directly in the constructors function for each parent contract.**\n\n### Example \n\n```\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\n// Parent contract\ncontract parentA {\n    function sayHello() public pure returns (string memory) {\n        return \"Hello from parentA!\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Child contract inheriting from parentA\ncontract childB is parentA {\n    // childB automatically inherits sayHello() from parentA\n    function sayHi() public pure returns (string memory) {\n        return \"Hi from childB!\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Why Use Inheritance?\n\n- **Code Reusability:** Write common logic once and reuse it in multiple contracts.\n- **Organization:** Separate concerns and organize code into logical components.\n- **Extensibility:** Easily extend or modify contract behavior by inheriting and overriding.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nInheritance in Solidity allows contracts to build upon each other, promoting code reuse and modularity.
