Always specify for clarity.\n- **Security**: Use `private` or `internal` to restrict access; `public` is an open invite.\n- **Gas**: `external` functions save gas for outside calls.\n\n## Value Data Types: The Data Building Blocks\n\nValue data types in Solidity are the core types for storing simple, fixed-size data directly in variables. They\u2019re passed by value (copied when used), unlike reference types (like arrays or structs). Here are examples:\n\n- **Boolean (`bool`)**:\n  - Stores `true` or `false`.\n  - Example: `bool isActive = true;`.\n  - Use Case: Flags or conditions, like `if (isActive) { ... }`.\n  - Size: 1 byte.\n\n- **Integer (`int` / `uint`)**:\n  - Signed (`int`) or unsigned (`uint`) integers, ranging from 8 to 256 bits (e.g `uint8`, `int256`).\n  - Example: `uint256 balance = 1000;` (0 to 2^256-1); `int32 temp = -50;` (signed).\n  - Use Case: Counters, balances, or calculations.\n  - Default: `uint256` or `int256` if unspecified.\n\n- **Address**:\n  - Holds a 20-byte Ethereum address. Two flavors:\n    - `address`: Basic address, e.g., `address owner = msg.sender;`.\n    - `address payable`: Can send/receive Ether, e.g `address payable recipient;`.\n  - Use Case: Store wallet or contract addresses for transfers or calls.\n  - Example: `recipient.transfer(1 ether);` (only with `payable`).\n\n- **Bytes (`bytes1` to `bytes32`)**:\n  - Fixed-size byte arrays (1 to 32 bytes), e.g., `bytes32 hash = keccak256(\"data\");`.\n  - Use Case: Store hashes or fixed-length raw data.\n  - Note: Cheaper than dynamic `bytes` (a reference type).\n\n- **Enum**:\n  - User-defined type for a set of named values.\n  - Example: `enum Status { Pending, Active, Closed } Status state = Status.Pending;`.\n  - Use Case: Define states, like order status in a marketplace.\n  ",

              "chunk": "# Visibility Specifiers in Solidity\n\nIn Solidity, visibility specifiers define the accessibility of variables and functions in a smart contract, controlling how and where they can be accessed. These specifiers are crucial for security, encapsulation, and modularity in contract design. Below is a summary of the visibility specifiers for variables and functions in Solidity (version 0.8.20), covering their meanings, use cases, and implications.\n\n## Solidity Visibility Specifiers\n\nSolidity provides four visibility specifiers: **public**, **internal**, **private**, and **external**. Each has distinct behavior for variables and functions, affecting whether they can be accessed within the contract, by derived contracts, externally by other contracts or accounts, or via transactions.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Public\n\n### Variables\n\n- **Definition:** A public state variable can be accessed from within the contract, derived contracts, other contracts, and externally (e.g., via a blockchain explorer or client).\n- **Behavior:** Solidity automatically generates a getter function for public state variables, allowing external read access. The variable can also be read and modified (if not constant or immutable) internally or by derived contracts.\n- **Gas Cost:** Getter functions for public variables incur gas costs when called externally, as they execute on-chain.\n- **Example:**\n    ```solidity\n    uint public myNumber = 42; // Accessible everywhere\n    ```\n    Accessing `myNumber` externally calls the auto-generated `myNumber()` getter.\n- **Use Case:** Use for state variables that need to be readable by users, other contracts, or dApps (e.g., token balances, contract settings).\n\n### Functions\n\n- **Definition:** A public function can be called from within the contract, by derived contracts, other contracts, or externally via transactions.\n- **Behavior:** Accessible by anyone, including external accounts (e.g., via MetaMask) and other contracts. Can read or modify state if not view or pure.\n- **",

Public variables expose data via getters, so use cautiously.\n- **Gas Efficiency**: `external` functions save gas for external calls compared to `public`. For variables, public getters add minor gas overhead.\n- **Conventions**: Prefix internal or private functions with `_` (e.g., `_mint`) to signal they're not user-facing.\n- **ERC-20 Context**: In tokens like USDC or DAI, `public` is used for balances and allowances to enable transparency, while `_mint` and `_burn` are internal to restrict minting/burning to authorized contracts.",
