In Solidity, it implies transparency of various parts of a smart contract or a piece of code thereby making these parts accessible by another piece of code or program.\n\n## Solidity Visibility Specifiers\n\nA variable in Solidity is a container, state or value holder that when initialized, causes a change to that smart contract (e.g transactions, signing, or any other task that can be done on a smart contract).\n\nA function is an executable piece of code that performs a task once called. The function holds variables known as state values, and returns a value of any type (available in solidity) as a response after its execution.\n\nIn solidity, there are **4 different visibility specifiers** and they affect both functions and variables alike. They determine the extent to which a function or variable can be accessed from outside the region of code where it was is initialized.\n\nThere are:\n\n1. **public** visibility specifier\n\n2. **private** visibility specifier\n\n3. **external** visibility specifier\n\n4. **internal** visibility specifier\n\n### Public Visibility Specifier\n\nIn solidity, variables and functions that are specified as publicly visible are accessible anywhere in the contract they were declared in, and also outside by other contracts.\n\nThey are declared with a  `public` keyword, and this signifies to the compiler that their scope should be made global within the contract.\n\n**NOTE:** When a storage variable is given public visibility, Solidity automatically creates an implicit getter function for that variable's value which can be used by other contracts to interact with that public variable.\n\n### Private Visibility Specifier\n\nIn Solidity, variables and functions that are specified as `private` are only accessible within the contract they are defined in.

There are four types of visibility specifiers in solidity:\n\n# 1. Public: \n Public is the most open visibility specifier in solidity, anything marked public can be accessed anywhere from inside the same contract, from inherited contracts, and also from external contracts. Solidity automatically declares a variable public if the visibility is not specified.\n\n\n\n# 2. Private: \nThis is the most restricted visibility in solidity. A function or variable with the specifier of private can only be used and accessed inside the contract where it was defined. It cannot be accessed by a derived contracts or externally. It is useful for keeping sensitive data hidden.\n\n\n\n#3. Internal: This is similar to private but slightly more flexible. Here, an internal function or variable can be accessed from inside the same contract, and a derived contract can also access a function or variable with a specifier of internal. Internal functions or variables cannot be accessed externally.\n\n\n#4. External: This can only be used with functions and not variables. It can be called from outside the contract which it was defined in adn cannot be accessed or called internally like a normal function. \n\n\n\n# Summary Notes\n\n- Use public when you want external and internal access.\n- Use private for internal-only access with no inheritance.\n- Use internal for access within the contract and derived contracts.\n- Use external when the function is meant to be called only from outside the contract (like APIs).",

Public Functions: These functions are part of the contract's ABI and can be called from anywhere(internally and externally) including other contracts or external accounts. They are acceessible through transaction calls and contract-to-contract calls. It is useful to specify public visibility for main contract interface functions and functions that need to be accessible by users and other contracts.\n\n2. Private Functions: Unlike public functions that can be called from anywhere, these are not part of the contract's ABI and are only accessible within the same contract. They also can't be inherited by derived contracts. Specifying private visibility on a function provides the highest level of restriction and is useful for internal helper functions and sensitive operations that should not be exposed.\n\n3. Internal Functions: These are accessible within the same contract and its derived contracts but cannot be accessed from external contracts or accounts. Like the private function, it isn't part of the contract's ABI. It is useful when dealing with functions that are shared betweeen parent and child contracts and other common utility functions for contract families.\n\n4. External Functions: Externals are only callable from outside the contract and are part of the contract's ABI. They cannot be called internally except using a self-reference in the format this.functionName(). They are useful in main entry points for external interactions and gas optimization functions with large parameters.\n\n\nVariable Visibility Specifiers\n\n1. Public Variables: These variables, like public functions, are part of the contract's ABI and are accessible from anywhere. They can be read by external contracts and account",
