The different data - types in solidity, how to declare variables in solidity, the different variable scopes in solidity,error handling interfaces and abstract contracts and many more!\n-Now to the details,\n-    The first thing I got from the class was that solidity is a typed language, and this means that every variable - that is declared must also come with its type. For example, if you define a variable a that stores a number. You must also declare that a is number like this 'uint8 a = 12'. uint meaning unsigned integer. There are two main types in solidity and they are Value and Reference. Individually, these types have different types under them.\n- Next, I learnt about writing smart contracts in solidity and how a smart contract file can be broken down into different parts. The first being the licensing, then the pragma version, and then the body of code. For the body of the code where variables are defined, these variables have three different types which are:- state, local and global. state variables store permanent data for blockchain while local variables store temporary variables and global variables are automatic variables that come with solidity(e.g msg.sender). Just like in javascript, solidity also has constants but there is a twist, solidity has two data types known as:- constant and immutable. Constant has to be hardcoded but immutable can be defined later in constructor.\nThen, I also learnt about error handling and there are three ways :- assert,require and revert. require must be done before the function calls so that gas can be refunded.\nThere is also inheritance in solidity like other object-oriented languages and it comes in form of interface and abstract constracts. Interfaces help two smart contracts to interact with each other without copying everything, you simply copy required functions and use it.. Ab",

I can't stress enough how understanding this distinction has been crucial for me in writing efficient and secure smart contracts.\n\n## A Brief Look Back - What I Learned About Solidity's Origins\n\nBefore diving into the technical details, I found it fascinating to learn a bit about Solidity's history and the broader context of smart contracts. Understanding where Solidity came from has helped me appreciate why it works the way it does.\n\nFrom what I've learned, Solidity was developed specifically for the Ethereum blockchain, designed to be a high-level programming language that could handle the complexities of smart contracts. Smart contracts themselves are essentially self-executing contracts where the terms are directly written into code - which means they run automatically when predetermined conditions are met, without needing intermediaries.\n\nThis background knowledge has really shaped how I think about writing code in Solidity. Every line I write isn't just regular programming - it's creating immutable, trustless agreements that will live on the blockchain. That responsibility has made me much more careful and thoughtful about my coding practices.\n\n## Value Types - My Understanding\n\nI like to think of value types as getting my very own, independent copy of a piece of information. I've come to understand them as simple, self-contained data points that I work with daily.\n\n### Value Types I Use Most:\n\n- **`bool`** - Boolean values (`true`/`false`) - I use these for simple yes/no logic\n- **`int`/`uint`** - Signed and unsigned integers - My go-to for numbers\n- **`address`** - Unique blockchain addresses - Essential for my smart contracts\n- **`bytesM`** - Fixed-size raw data - I use these for specific data storage\n- **`enum`** - Defined set of named choices - Great for my s",

It runs on Ethereum Virtual Machine and it compiles human readable code to bytecode.\n\n---\n\n## Solidity Data types\nJust as we have data types in JavaScript, Solidity also has its own. But Solidity does not have the types undefined or null, instead, if you make a new variable and don\u2019t give it a value, Solidity gives it a default value which depends on its type.\n\n### Value Types vs. Reference Types\nValue types like numbers, booleans, addresses get COPIED when you use them while Reference types like arrays and structs are SHARED i.e you both point to the same thing.\nExamples of value types - uint(Numbers that can\u2019t be negative), int (numbers that can be negative), address, bool and bytes\n\n##### There are data types referred to as composite data types because they are composed from other primitive data types - structs and mappings\nStructs gives the ability to define a custom type so that can be used to  organize and collect pieces of data into one larger data type.\nmapping in Solidity is a key-value store where each key maps to a value, providing constant-time lookup. It cannot be iterated or passed as parameters externally.\n\n---\n\n## Smart contracts\nWe looked into smart contract with an example and what smart contract codes mean. e.g\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT -> This line specifies the License of the contract code\npragma solidity ^0.8.8.0; -> This is compulsory and it must be the first line of code in every solidity file because it tells the EVM which compiler version to use in compiling.\n\ncontract HotFudgeSauce {\n    uint public qtyCups;\n\n    // Get the current hot fudge quantit",

This bytecode gets deployed and stored on EVM or other EVM compatible machines. Solidity is used for writing Smart contracts.\n\n## Components of Solidity\n- The first comment which is a machine readable line ( // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT) that specifies the licensing that covers the code.\n- The pragma directive that is usually the first line of code in any Solidity file. Pragma is a directive that tells the compiler which compiler version it should use to convert the human-readable Solidity code to machine readable bytecode.\n- Semicolons are essential in Solidity. \n- The contracts\n- The functions which are executable codes.\n\n## Variable Scope in Smart Contracts\nThere are three variable scope in Smart contracts\n- **State Variables** : These store permanent data in the Smart contract. They are found inside the contract but outside the function\n- **Local Variables** : These hold data for a very short time usually during computation. They are found inside the function and can not be accessed outside the function\n- **Global Variables** : these variables and functions are \u201cinjected\u201d into your code by Solidity, and made available without the need to specifically create or import them from anywhere. These provide information about the blockchain environment the code is running on and also include utility functions for general use in the program.\n\n## Types of Visibilities\n- **Public functions and variables** can be accessed inside the contract, outside it, from other smart contracts, and from external accounts.\n- **Private functions and variables** are only accessible within the smart contract that declares them.\n- **Internal visibility is similar** to private visibility, in that internal functions and variables can only be accessed",
